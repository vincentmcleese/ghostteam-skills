## GREG ISENBERG POSTS

### Long-Form Prediction/Analysis

```
The $1.1T App Store doesn't DIE. It's going to EXPLODE.

Claude Code makes it so anyone can ship an app, which means the App Store fills up 10× faster than before.

Most are AI junk. But A few are surprisingly good and PERSONAL instead of UNIVERSAL.

Apple will get stricter and add more filters. How else are they going to deal with the flood of apps and making it easy for people to find them?

At the same time, the types of apps will change over the next 12 months:

People start building very specific apps for very specific situations.

"An app that tells me if my snoring last night was bad enough to wake my partner" instead of a generic sleep tracker

Basically, moving from general purpose to very specific apps that spread through screenshots, screen recordings, and friends sending links.

Most of these apps never try to get "huge" in the traditional VC sense.

They don't need tens of millions of users. A few thousand people paying $5‒$10 a month turns into life changing money.

Some people get wildly rich from this. If all of a sudden, they have a portfolio of apps doing $5M in ARR with no investors, they've easily built $50M of enterprise value while taking distributions of $500k+/year.

Pretty crazy. People will see this and many will jump into the app building game. It'll get popular and then probably too popular at one point.

Lot of people in Silicon Valley say everyone will be an app creator in this new world. I'm not sure that's true. Probably not everyone.

A lot of people still won't build apps, the same way most people aren't youtube creators. They just want consume the content an enjoy it.

Over time, the App Store starts to feel different.

Basically, software feels more indie, more personal. This era is way better for people who want to build apps, people who want more personal apps but maybe worse off for apple (gotta deal with the slop)

But definitely it doesn't kill the app store.

The app store explodes.
```

**Pattern:** Bold contrarian hook → detailed reasoning with specific examples → nuanced acknowledgment → bookend closer

### Numbered Deep-Dive Observation

```
ive been hanging out with founders under 25 lately living in sf/nyc and they're built different.

my observations of these young founders getting rich with AI:

1. these kids grew up watching YT creators flexing Porsches and private jets from their bedrooms. but when they looked at their own reality, they saw $200k college tuition and $50k entry-level jobs. the math didn't work. so they decided to skip the broken system entirely.

2. that economic reality shaped everything about them. they're unapologetically capitalistic in a way that reminds me of the 1980s Wall Street era. pure survival capitalism. they think they need millions just to live comfortably, they look at $4,000 studio apartments in ny, and they're not wrong. tons of economic pressure for everyone right now and inflation worries.

3. so they formed group chats with other founders. their mentors are podcasts. they're plugged in and learning 24/7, treating business like a multiplayer video game they're trying to beat.

4. sam altman said something that stuck with me: older generations use ChatGPT as a Google replacement, but these kids use it as an operating system. they see this AI era as their gateway out of economic reality.

5. everything they do is optimized for virality. their startup journey reads like a Netflix documentary with built-in trailers. every product decision considers "will this clip work on X?" they reverse engineer social algorithms with their business models. it's like NELK Boys meets Spielberg meets YC demo day.

6. they build products designed to go viral on specific platforms. they'll time launches around trending topics. they'll create TikToks showcasing their SaaS tool like entertainment content.

7. some go the cash flow route, building consumer mobile apps like nikita or build saas portfolios. others raise millions in VC funding. the more the vc the better they think.

8. they document every failure, breakthrough, and late-night coding session. their businesses are performance art for the algorithm age.

9. they're not trying to fix the broken system that priced them out. they're building entirely around it. and they're winning because they accepted the new rules while everyone else is still playing by the old ones.

10. a lot will fail in public and end up working at companies. it'll be crushing. especially the ones that raise tons of vc. that's the game. but some will succeed in ways we've never seen before.

11. they think in portfolios from day one. not "this is my startup," but "this is one bet." apps, tools, experiments, accounts. they expect most to die and one to change their life.

12. many are hyper-capitalistic. michael douglas in wall street energy, but with claude, cursor, and viral clips instead of suspenders and cigars. theyve got big dreams and aren't afraid to go after them.

13. the same inflated world that crushed previous generations might have created the most resourceful generation of entrepreneurs we've ever seen. they are turning systemic failure into competitive advantage.

pretty genius when you think about it. the kids are alright.

### Framework/How-To Post

```
HOW TO BUILD A BIG CONSUMER B2C MOBILE APP IN 2025

1. start with a single recurring behavior people already document, like meals, sleep, workouts, studying, dating, or routines.

2. anchor the app to one question users already ask themselves daily, like "am I doing this right?"
```

**Pattern:** ALL CAPS headline with year → numbered actionable steps → specific examples in each step

---

### Bold Claim Posts (Short)

```
2025 is the GREATEST time to build a startup in 20 years

I'm 38. I've sold 2 startups, helped build companies that raised billions, and backed teams from seed to unicorn.

5 MEGA shifts that make this the BEST time to build in a GENERATION:

1. Hardware got smart...
```

**Pattern:** Bold superlative claim → credibility statement → numbered mega-points

### Punchy One-Liners

```
you're a few .md files from being able to outperform 99% of people on this planet
```

```
claude code will probably make 10,000 people millionaires if not more
```

```
a huge number of "ai products" feel impressive for 48 hours and then quietly exit your life without friction, which is starting to look like the defining failure mode of this cycle
```

```
In a year, the internet will be really different.

We're seeing just tip of the iceberg of what Claude code can do.

Crazy times.
```

```
One sounds better
```

```
Today I learned Obsidian is 100% user-supported and not backed by VC investors
```

**Pattern:** Single complete thought. Specific enough to be interesting, broad enough to be shareable. Strong opinion without hedging. Often lowercase.

---

### Quick Energy Posts

```
2025 officially starts tomorrow

most people back to work

glhf everyone, make it count
```

**Pattern:** Timely context → observation → casual sign-off with personality

---

### Community Engagement

```
Please tag who you want me to interview in January for @startupideaspod

The show gets ~3M listens/month

It can be anyone that you think you can learn from. Practical AI tutorials, startup ideas and growth tactics.

I'll DM the most interesting ones!
```

**Pattern:** Clear ask → social proof (numbers) → scope → promise of action

### Skills/System Showcase (Pinned Post)

```
10 skills to turn Claude Code into a marketing team that sells

1. I start with my positioning-angle skill to find a unique value proposition
2. I use lead-magnet to research mechanisms to generate emails
3. direct-response-copy to write powerful hooks and copy that persuades/influences
4. email-sequences to create powerful drip campaigns
5. keyword-research to find seo/geo topics to drive traffic
6. seo-content to create high quality articles that rank and drive organic visits
7. newsletter-skill to create ongoing communication with prospects and customers
8. content-atomizer to repurpose newsletters and articles into video scripts, social posts
9. brand-voice to codify my writing style for future assets/websites/landing pages
10. an orchestrator agent to guide me if I need help

to polish it off, I design my page with the front-end design skill from anthropic

I've done the research, testing, and fed it tons of examples of "what good looks like"

here's a live example http://thevibemarketer.com/skills

*yes you can get these here if you want them, my skills wrote the copy, found the angle, etc.!

a few extra conversions from better copy alone and it pays for itself
```

**Pattern:** Numbered system breakdown → each point explains what it does → proof/example link → soft sell at end

---

### Tool Capability Observation

```
I really don't think people grasp how powerful Claude's Agent SDK is or the implications...

Build agents in natural language that run in loops until the job is done with access to unlimited tools and custom skills
```

**Pattern:** "I don't think people grasp..." hook → explain what it actually does

---

### Learning/Process Post

```
I learned Claude Code for marketing by learning how to code with it first.

This is the boring answer but the best one.

To get the most out of it as a non-technical person you have to know what its capabilities are.

So if your goal is to leverage Claude Code for knowledge
```

**Pattern:** Counterintuitive advice → acknowledge it's not sexy → practical reasoning

---

### Community Discovery

```
Lots of people are starting to discover Claude Code for non technical stuff

But most of the information is fragmented

Someone building a second brain with obsidian, automating books and accounting there, executing marketing here

What are your favorite non-technical uses?
```

**Pattern:** Name emerging trend → identify the gap → specific examples → collaborative question

---

### Personal Use Case

```
I want an accountant that uses claude code...I just reconciled one of my local businesses books today and I'm far from being an expert

loaded in bank statements, receipts, invoices, etc. and created a lifetime overview, a q4 report, and a CFO level deep dive in a couple hours
```

**Pattern:** Wish/observation → personal proof → specific deliverables

---

### Framework Images

```
how to rank on search engines/llms and still sound like a human

(give this image to AI for your next article/blog post/etc)
```

```
how to write better copy than 99% of websites on the internet

(give this image to AI for your next ad/landing page/etc)
```

**Pattern:** "how to [outcome]" → instruction for using attached image

---

### Wisdom Distillation

```
two ways to get the most out of AI:

1. know what questions to ask
2. know what good looks like
```

**Pattern:** Simple numbered framework. Memorable. Quotable.

---

### One-Liners

```
apparently we reached AGI and called it Ralph Wiggum
```

```
Build distribution (but use Claude Code / Gemini for that too 😉)
```

```
Marketing in 2025 is going to look a lot different. Big things coming soon.
```

**Pattern:** Cultural reference OR parenthetical addition OR teaser

## KEY PATTERNS ACROSS BOTH

### Hook Types That Work
1. **Contrarian:** "X doesn't die. It EXPLODES."
2. **Personal observation:** "ive been hanging out with..."
3. **Underestimation:** "I don't think people grasp..."
4. **Bold claim:** "claude code will probably make 10,000 people millionaires"
5. **Pattern naming:** "a huge number of ai products feel impressive for 48 hours and then..."
6. **How-to:** "how to [specific outcome]"
7. **Numbered list tease:** "10 skills to turn Claude Code into..."

### Structure That Works
1. One sentence per line
2. Specific numbers always ($200k, 48 hours, 99%, 10,000)
3. Real tool names (Claude, ChatGPT, Obsidian, n8n)
4. Lowercase for casual tone
5. Pop culture references people recognize
6. End with punch (memorable closer or question)
7. White space between ideas

### Tone That Works
1. Anti-gatekeeping energy
2. "I did this" not "you should do this"
3. Acknowledge nuance without hedging the main point
4. Excited but not hype-y
5. Mentor talking to peers, not guru to followers
6. Self-aware about being "boring" or obvious when relevant
