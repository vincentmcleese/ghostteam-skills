# LinkedIn to X Post Converter

Transform LinkedIn posts into high-performing X posts. Applies proven writing principles and generates multiple format variations.

## Core Writing Principles

These principles determine whether converted content gets ignored or goes viral. Apply ALL of them during every conversion.

### 1. Genuinely Valuable

Don't just compress a LinkedIn post. Pull out the fresh insight that hasn't been beaten to death on X. The thing that could genuinely shift how someone approaches their work.

**Before finalizing, ask:** Would I bookmark this if someone else wrote it? If no, keep working.

### 2. Immediately Actionable

An insight without a blueprint is entertainment, not education.

**Bad conversion:** "wow this new AI tool is absolutely insane"
**Good conversion:** "how to [specific outcome] with [tool]:" + walk through the actual process step by step

People don't follow because you noticed something—they follow because you taught them how to use it.

### 3. Sparks Natural Engagement

Never beg: "like if you agree" or "retweet this if you found it helpful" looks desperate.

**For bookmarks:** Use "here's how" or "how to" or "do this" in the hook. People on autopilot see something useful, bookmark it, keep scrolling.

**For replies - two approaches:**
- **Controversial stance:** Take a strong position the LinkedIn post hints at — people argue or back you up
- **Collaborative opening:** "this is the workflow i'm using right now, curious if anyone's tested this approach with [alternative]" — people share experiences

### 4. Ridiculously Easy to Read

People scroll at insane speeds. One second to decide whether to engage.

- **Hook:** Short and punchy. One line. "how to X" or "why X doesn't work" or "the X mistake you're making"
- **Structure:** One sentence per line. Creates rhythm. Easy to process visually.
- **Lists:** Use "-" or ">" or "1." for complex information. People can skim and grab main points.
- **White space:** Space between lines gives eyes a place to rest. Solid blocks of text feel exhausting.
- **Language:** Simplify everything. Conversational tone like a mentor talking to students.
  - "use" not "utilize"
  - "help" not "facilitate"
  - "get better" not "optimize performance"
  - If a 14-year-old couldn't understand it, it's too complex

### 5. Recognizable Style

Same content written in same style everywhere blends into generic AI-sounding soup.

Structural elements to use consistently:
- Use ">" to break down processes
- Start with bold claims or personal observations
- Write in fragments sometimes for emphasis
- Use "tbh" or "honestly" before controversial takes

Consistency without being formulaic. Patterns people recognize, but not filling in a template.

## LinkedIn → X Translation Rules

LinkedIn posts are longer, more structured, and more professional. When converting:

| LinkedIn Element | X Translation |
|-----------------|---------------|
| 242-word detailed explanation | Extract the ONE core insight |
| "So... I now have a $X/month [service]" hooks | "I replaced a $X/month [service]. With [tool]." |
| 15-25 use case lists | Pick top 3-5 that prove the point |
| Professional-casual tone | Ultra-casual, mentor-to-peer tone |
| Step-by-step tutorials | Compress to ">" or numbered steps |
| Detailed context/background | Cut ruthlessly — trust the audience |
| CTAs for comments/follows | Never beg for engagement on X |

### What to Keep
- Specific dollar amounts and metrics (these CRUSH on X)
- Actual tool names (Claude, n8n, ChatGPT, etc.)
- Personal experience framing ("I built..." not "You should...")
- Anti-gatekeeping energy ("You can do this too")

### What to Drop
- Professional hedging and qualifiers
- Long context-setting paragraphs
- "So..." hook openers
- Formal structure and headers
- Excessive use case lists (pick the best ones)

## Proven Hook Types

Transform LinkedIn hooks using these X-native patterns:

| Hook Type | Pattern | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Contrarian | "X doesn't [expected]. It [opposite]." | "The App Store doesn't DIE. It's going to EXPLODE." |
| Personal observation | "[lowercase] ive been [doing X] and [insight]" | "ive been hanging out with founders under 25 lately and they're built different" |
| Underestimation | "I don't think people grasp [thing]..." | "I really don't think people grasp how powerful Claude's Agent SDK is..." |
| Bold prediction | "[tool] will probably [big outcome]" | "claude code will probably make 10,000 people millionaires" |
| Pattern naming | "a huge number of [X] [behavior pattern]" | "a huge number of ai products feel impressive for 48 hours and then quietly exit your life" |
| How-to | "how to [specific outcome]" | "how to rank on search engines/llms and still sound like a human" |
| System tease | "[number] [things] to [outcome]" | "10 skills to turn Claude Code into a marketing team that sells" |
| Simple wisdom | "[number] ways to [outcome]:" | "two ways to get the most out of AI:" |
| Cost shock | "I replaced a $X/month [thing]. With [tool]." | "I replaced a $50k/month agency. With Claude." |

### Hook Translation Examples

| LinkedIn Hook | X Hook |
|--------------|--------|
| "So... I now have a $50k/month market research agency in Claude" | "I replaced a $50k/month agency. With Claude." |
| "NEW release: Claude now has SKILLS..." | "claude just got superpowers" |
| "Here's how we automated our entire SEO pipeline..." | "how to do $15k/month SEO for <$100 with AI" |
| "I wanted to share some insights about AI automation..." | Drop entirely — start with the insight itself |

## The 6 Formats

Every LinkedIn post gets converted into ALL 6 formats. Present them ready to copy-paste.

### Format 1: LONG-FORM (No character limit)

```

### Format 6: HOT TAKE / CONTROVERSIAL

Strong opinion that invites debate.

**When to use:** When the LinkedIn post contains a strong opinion, contrarian view, or prediction
**Engagement:** Maximum replies, high impressions from debate, follower growth

**Characteristics:**
- Clear stance on divisive topic
- Challenges conventional wisdom
- Invites replies (agreement or argument)
- Uses "tbh" or "honestly" before the take

## Conversion Process

### Step 1: Analyze the LinkedIn Post
- Identify the ONE core insight (strip everything else)
- Extract key metrics and numbers
- Determine the best hook angle from the Proven Hook Types table
- Note which formats naturally fit the content

### Step 2: Apply Core Writing Principles
For each format, check:
- Is it genuinely valuable? (Would I bookmark this?)
- Is it immediately actionable? (Can someone DO something with this?)
- Does it spark natural engagement? (No begging)
- Is it ridiculously easy to read? (One sentence per line, white space, simple language)
- Does it have recognizable style? (Not generic AI soup)

### Step 3: Generate All 6 Formats
Create complete, ready-to-post versions. Each format should feel native to X, not like a compressed LinkedIn post.

### Step 4: Recommend Top Pick
Note which format(s) work best for this specific content and why.

## Output Format

For every LinkedIn post conversion:

### 1. Quick Analysis
```
Core insight: [one sentence]
Best hook angle: [which hook type from table above]
Content type: [announcement/tutorial/results/observation/opinion]
Key metrics: [specific numbers worth keeping]
```

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing, verify EVERY format passes:

**Core Principles:**
- [ ] Would I bookmark this? (Genuinely valuable)
- [ ] Can someone act on this? (Immediately actionable)
- [ ] Does it invite engagement naturally? (No begging)
- [ ] Is it scannable? (One sentence per line, white space)
- [ ] Does it sound like a real person? (Not AI soup)

**Voice:**
- [ ] Maintains specific numbers/metrics from LinkedIn post
- [ ] Names actual tools (Claude, n8n, ChatGPT, etc.)
- [ ] Uses "I did this" framing, not "you should do this"
- [ ] Anti-gatekeeping energy
- [ ] Casual and excited, not just educational
- [ ] Lowercase used strategically where appropriate

**X-Native Feel:**
- [ ] Doesn't feel like a compressed LinkedIn post
- [ ] Hook stops the scroll
- [ ] White space between ideas
- [ ] Simple language (14-year-old test)
- [ ] No engagement begging
- [ ] Strong closer

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Compressing instead of translating:** Don't just shorten the LinkedIn post. Re-think it for X from scratch using the core insight.
2. **Too formal:** X is casual. Write like you're texting a smart friend.
3. **Missing proof:** Specific results/numbers from the LinkedIn post are GOLD on X. Keep them.
4. **No personality:** Opinions and excitement matter more on X than LinkedIn.
5. **Over-explaining:** Trust the audience to be smart. Cut ruthlessly.
6. **Wall of text:** One sentence per line. White space is your friend.
7. **Generic hooks:** "Here's what I learned about AI" → boring. "I replaced a $50k/month agency. With Claude." → stops the scroll.
8. **Begging for engagement:** Never ask for likes/retweets/follows.
9. **Same format every time:** Mix it up. If Quick Takes are crushing it, lean in, but variety matters.
