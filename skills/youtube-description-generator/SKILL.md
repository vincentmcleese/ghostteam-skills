Here's what we cover:

→ The Adobe Launch: All three apps - Photoshop, Express, and Acrobat - are now live in ChatGPT. What each one does and how to connect them.
→ Live Demo - Acrobat: Testing PDF splitting, redaction, and document editing. See where it works and where it breaks.
→ Live Demo - Photoshop: Background blur, removal, and black & white conversion. The slider UI is genuinely impressive for in-chat editing.
→ Live Demo - Express: Creating invitations and templates. Multi-step workflow design that keeps you in the chat experience.
→ The Freemium Strategy: Why Adobe is giving this away for free - and how they're using ChatGPT as a distribution channel to upsell premium subscriptions.
→ UX Innovation: Interactive sliders and preview widgets we haven't seen in any other ChatGPT app. Why this sets a new standard.
→ Design Principles Analysis: Testing Adobe's apps against OpenAI's official UX guidelines. What they got right and what needs work.
→ The Bigger Picture: Why intent-based, natural language interfaces are replacing complex menu-driven UX - and what this means for SaaS.

These apps are US-only for now (VPN required). Early bugs exist, but the potential here is massive.
