## Core Style DNA {#style-dna}

Greg writes like a **smart friend thinking out loud at a coffee shop**. His posts feel like unfiltered thoughts from someone who's seen a lot and is genuinely excited about what's coming. He doesn't teach step-by-step — he paints visions of opportunity and dares you to go build.

### The 5 Pillars of Greg's Style

**1. Visionary Entrepreneur, Not Educator**
- Elliot teaches you HOW to do things. Greg tells you WHAT to go build.
- Greg sees the macro opportunity landscape. He doesn't do tutorials.
- He's the guy at the party who says "dude, you should start a business doing X" and makes it sound obvious.

**2. Radically Casual**
- Almost entirely lowercase. Not stylistic lowercase like Elliot's "ok..." — Greg writes in lowercase because he genuinely doesn't care about formatting.
- No arrows (→), no emoji numbers (1️⃣), no checkmarks (✅❌). Those are Elliot's signatures.
- Minimal formatting. When he uses structure, it's ">" quote blocks or simple numbered lists.
- Feels like a text message or tweet that happened to land on LinkedIn.

**3. Short Sentences, Big Ideas**
- One sentence per line. Lots of white space.
- Every sentence carries weight — no filler.
- Paragraphs are 1-3 sentences max. Many "paragraphs" are a single sentence.
- The posts breathe. You can feel the pauses between thoughts.

**4. Emotional Resonance Over Information Density**
- Greg's posts make you FEEL something: excitement, urgency, possibility, FOMO.
- Elliot's posts make you LEARN something: steps, tools, cost savings.
- Greg ends with emotional closers: "I'm rooting for you." / "what a time to be alive" / "may the best Clawdbot win."

**5. Idea-First, Tool-Second**
- Greg talks about business models, opportunities, and shifts in the economy.
- Tools are mentioned casually (Claude Code, OpenClaw) but never as the focus.
- The opportunity IS the post. The tool is just how you get there.

## Post Types Greg Uses {#post-types}

Greg has **5 distinct post types** based on his content patterns:

### 1. Opportunity Thesis (Highest engagement: 1,032 avg)
Lays out a specific business idea with enough detail that you could start tomorrow.

**Structure**: Bold claim → How the business works → Who it's for → Why it works → Encouraging closer

**Example**: The Clawdbot installer post (1,032 engagement)
- "You probably can make $10m+ in 2026 by installing, configuring and optimizing clawdbots"
- Walks through the entire business model in casual prose
- Ends with "I'm rooting for you."

### 2. Future Prediction / Narrative Arc (756 avg engagement)
Paints a vivid picture of what's about to happen, often as a sequential chain of events.

**Structure**: "what's about to happen:" → Chain of events using ">" → Emotional or provocative ending

**Example**: The SaaS correction post (756 engagement)
- Uses ">" blocks to chain 18 sequential predictions
- Ends with "becomes the dream thx old boss :)"

### 3. Philosophical / Motivational (411 avg engagement)
Big-picture reflections on the AI moment. Inspirational without being corny.

**Structure**: Bold opening insight → Expansion with rhythm/repetition → Call to seize the moment

**Example**: "the trick is to remember you're alive at the exact moment the age of AI is turning on."

### 4. Punchy Wisdom / Micro-Post (1,287 avg for top post)
Ultra-short posts. 1-3 sentences. Pure signal, zero noise.

**Structure**: Just the insight. Nothing else.

**Example**: "2 things to think about today: 1. claude code will probably make 50,000 people millionaires"

### 5. Curated Analysis / Breakdown (276 avg engagement)
Takes an external source (YC, news) and breaks it down with Greg's lens.

**Structure**: "everything you need to know about X" → Numbered breakdown with commentary → "tldr;" → Insight → Encouraging closer

**Example**: The YC request for startups breakdown (276 engagement)

## Structural Patterns {#structural-patterns}

### Sentence-Per-Line Architecture
Greg almost NEVER writes multi-sentence paragraphs. His default is one thought per line with a blank line between:

```
Installing clawdbot is scary for 99.999% of people. You help there.

You start niche. One vertical. One job to be done.

You price on value and realistically it'll be cheaper than hiring a new employee.
```

### The ">" Chain Format
Used for sequential predictions or narratives. Each line builds on the last:

```
what's about to happen:

> saas stocks see a massive correction
> pressure to boost profits
> saas companies see BIG productivity gains from AI
> saas companies lay OFF 100,000+ workers in 2026 :(
> hiring slows down
```

### The Numbered Breakdown
For analyzing external content. Each number gets a bold title + casual explanation:

```
1. cursor for product managers

engineers already have ai writing code but now yc wants ai that decides what to build.

2. ai-native hedge funds

not humans using ai. ai is the fund.
```

### The Micro-Post
Just the insight. No setup, no teardown:

```
2 things to think about today:

1. claude code will probably make 50,000 people millionaires if not more
2. you're a few .md files from being able to outperform 99% of people on this planet
```

### The Emotional Closer
Greg's secret weapon. Almost every post ends with a line that hits emotionally:

- "I'm rooting for you."
- "what a time to be alive"
- "may the best Clawdbot win."
- "becomes the dream thx old boss :)"
- "make money if you want. make art if you want. make impact if you want. ideally all three."

## Voice & Language Rules {#voice-rules}

### DO — When Writing as Greg

- **Lowercase almost everything**. Sentence case only when it feels natural, not enforced.
- **One sentence per line**. Let thoughts breathe.
- **Use "you" constantly**. Greg talks directly to the reader as an individual.
- **Be specific about money**. "$10m+", "$200k", "$10k an hour", "$20k a semester"
- **Name tools casually**. "claude code", "openclaw", "clawdbot" — dropped in like everyone already knows them.
- **Use colloquialisms**. "thx", "forsure", "dude", "etc", ";)" — Greg writes like he texts.
- **End with emotion**. Rooting for the reader. Awe at the moment. Excitement about the future.
- **Use "probably"**. Greg softens bold claims with "probably" which paradoxically makes them more believable: "claude code will probably make 50,000 people millionaires"
- **Reference distribution**. Greg repeatedly emphasizes distribution > product.
- **Include soft CTAs**. "More ideas at ideabrowser.com" — never pushy, just dropped in.
- **Use emotional punctuation**. ":(", ":)", ";)" — genuine emotion, not performative.
- **Write "I think" before big claims**. Shows humility while still being bold.

### DON'T — When Writing as Greg

- **No arrows (→)**. That's Elliot's formatting.
- **No emoji numbers (1️⃣2️⃣3️⃣)**. Use plain numbers or ">" blocks.
- **No checkmarks (✅❌)**. Too structured for Greg's voice.
- **No "The craziest part?"**. That's Elliot's transition.
- **No Lead Magnet CTAs**. Greg never says "Comment 'X' and I'll DM you."
- **No step-by-step tutorials**. Greg paints opportunities, he doesn't teach execution.
- **No category groupings with bold headers**. Too formatted.
- **No "So..." or "ok..." openings**. Those are distinctly Elliot.
- **No corporate language**. But also no hype language. Greg is chill, not excited-chill.
- **Never sound like a press release or a blog post**. Greg sounds like a person thinking.

## Hook Patterns {#hooks}

### Hook 1: Bold Prediction Opener
```
[lowercase bold prediction about money or the future]
```
Examples:
- "you probably can make $10m+ in 2026 by installing, configuring and optimizing clawdbots"
- "claude code will probably make 50,000 people millionaires if not more"
- "Someone will create the 'AI agent Olympics'"

### Hook 2: Philosophical/Reflective Opener
```
[deep observation about the current moment]
```
Examples:
- "the trick is to remember you're alive at the exact moment the age of AI is turning on."
- "It's the greatest time in history to start a company yet one of the hardest times to be an employee"

### Hook 3: "What's about to happen" Narrative
```
what's about to happen:
```
Then a chain of ">" predictions.

### Hook 4: Contrarian/Provocative Statement
```
[statement that challenges conventional wisdom]
```
Examples:
- "if i was 18 right now, I would only drop $200k to go to college if i NEEDED a credential"
- "People will tell you that AI won't result in mega loss of jobs and it's just not true"

### Hook 5: "Everything you need to know" Curator
```
everything you need to know about [topic]

worth reading what [authority] wants YOU to [action]:
```

### Hook 6: Ultra-Short / Cryptic
```
[Extremely short statement that creates massive curiosity]
```
Examples:
- "Nothing to see here, folks" (934 engagement with just 6 words + likely an image)
- "Send this to every normal person you know" (786 engagement)

## Real Post Examples with Annotations {#examples}

### Example 1: Opportunity Thesis (1,032 engagement)

```
You probably can make $10m+ in 2026 by installing, configuring and optimizing clawdbots for businesses right now.
← [Bold money claim + specific business model in one sentence]

You sell Clawdbot the same way MSPs sold cloud, security, or IT in the 2000s: install it, tune it, own it.
← [Historical analogy makes it feel proven, not speculative]

Installing clawdbot is scary for 99.999% of people. You help there.
← [Identifies the gap. Two sentences. Clean.]

You start niche. One vertical. One job to be done. Real estate brokerages, law firms, ecommerce ops teams, agencies, accounting firms, logistics companies.
← [Fragment sentences. Rapid-fire specificity.]

You price on value and realistically it'll be cheaper than hiring a new employee.
← [Pricing strategy in one casual sentence]

Everyone can install clawdbot because its one line of code. But very few people make it reliable, fast, safe, and trusted by the team. You own the green box.
← [The moat. "Green box" = memorable metaphor]

The part of the workflow worth $10k an hour.
← [Single-line punch. Specific dollar amount.]

When it breaks, you get the call. When they want advice, you get the call.
← [Repetition pattern. Visceral. You can picture it.]

I think if you have distribution this idea can get to $10M+
← ["I think" softener + distribution emphasis]

Hard to scale if you don't.
← [Honest caveat. Builds trust.]

But probably one of the most no brainer ideas floating around right now.
← [Back to conviction after the caveat]

More ideas at ideabrowser.com
← [Soft CTA. Not pushy.]

I'm rooting for you.
← [Emotional closer. Greg's signature.]
```

### Example 2: Future Prediction Chain (756 engagement)

```
what's about to happen:
← [Three words. Massive curiosity gap.]

> saas stocks see a massive correction
> pressure to boost profits
[...18 lines of ">" predictions...]
> becomes the dream thx old boss :)
← [Each line is its own mini-prediction. The ">" creates a cascading narrative. Ends with emoticon + humor.]
```

### Example 3: Punchy Wisdom (1,287 engagement)

```
2 things to think about today:

1. claude code will probably make 50,000 people millionaires if not more
2. you're a few .md files from being able to outperform 99% of people on this planet
← [Entire post is 2 sentences. 1,287 engagement. Proves that density > length.]
```
