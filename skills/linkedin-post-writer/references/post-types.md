## Multi-Type Strategy {#multi-type}

The highest-performing posts combine multiple types. When writing, identify ALL relevant types and create versions for each.

**Example**: The "$50k/month market research agency" post (8,864 engagement) was simultaneously:
- **Lead Magnet** (has comment CTA)
- **Tool Announcement** (Apify MCP release)
- **Tutorial** (step-by-step with emoji numbers)
- **Cost Transformation** (implied $50k → $100)

**Strategy**: When a topic fits 3+ types, the Lead Magnet version will likely perform best because it combines value demonstration with engagement mechanics.

---

## Expansion Strategy {#expansion}

### Turning a Simple Idea into a Full Post

**From**: "AI can do market research now"

**Expand to**:
1. **Specific tool**: Claude + Apify MCP
2. **Specific cost**: $50k/month agency → <$100/month
3. **Specific use cases**: Competitor analysis, review scraping, lead scoring, sentiment analysis, pricing intelligence
4. **Specific steps**: 1️⃣ Configure MCP → 2️⃣ Prompt Claude → 3️⃣ Generate report
5. **Specific results**: "Interactive HTML dashboard with charts and insights"
6. **Impact statement**: "Everything that used to require entire departments now happens in one conversation"

### Use Case Expansion Formula

Start with 3-5 obvious use cases, then expand by asking:
- What other industries need this?
- What other departments could use it?
- What adjacent workflows does it enable?
- What manual processes does it replace?

Target 15-25 use cases across 3-5 categories for Lead Magnet posts.

---

## Formatting Rules {#formatting}

### Arrows (→) — Use for feature/capability lists
```
Sales Automation:
→ Extract contact data from Apollo and LinkedIn
→ Analyse customer reviews to find pain points
→ Score leads based on review sentiment
→ Generate personalised outreach messages
```

### Emoji Numbers (1️⃣2️⃣3️⃣) — Use for tutorial steps
```
1️⃣ Gather the data → Prompted Claude to scrape YouTube comments
2️⃣ Analyse everything → Claude found patterns in pain points
3️⃣ Build the website → Claude generated a full interactive report
```

### Checkmarks (✅ ❌) — Use for before/after comparisons
```
Most teams are still manually:
❌ Reviewing websites and taking notes
❌ Brainstorming keywords without data
❌ Jumping between 5+ SEO tools

Meanwhile, with Claude + MCPs:
✅ One conversation handles everything
✅ Real data validates every decision
✅ Actionable insights, not theoretical advice
```

### Category Groupings — Use for extensive use case lists
```
Content Research Automation:
→ [use case 1]
→ [use case 2]

Competitor Content Analysis:
→ [use case 1]
→ [use case 2]

Customer Review Intelligence:
→ [use case 1]
→ [use case 2]
```
