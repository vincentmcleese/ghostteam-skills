# LinkedIn Post Writer

Write high-performing LinkedIn posts using a unified writing system built from analysis of 200+ posts across top creators.

## How This Skill Works

The default voice is **Elliot Garreffa** — but the writing engine is informed by proven patterns from **Greg Isenberg** and other top performers. Greg's best techniques (emotional closers, one-sentence-per-line breathing room, bold claims softened with "probably", the ">" chain format for predictions, ultra-short micro-posts) are available as tools in every post, not locked behind a style switch.

**Default mode**: Elliot's voice + the best structural and emotional techniques from Greg, blended naturally.

**Greg Isenberg mode**: When the user says "write this in Greg's style" or "Greg Isenberg style", shift to predominantly Greg's voice. Read `references/greg-isenberg-style.md` for the complete Greg voice guide before writing.

Before writing any post, read `references/post-types.md` for the complete post type taxonomy, hook patterns, and structural rules.

## Core Writing Principles (Learned From Both Creators)

These principles apply to EVERY post regardless of type or voice.

### 1. One Big Idea Per Post
Greg's highest-performing post was two sentences (1,287 engagement). Elliot's best posts focus on one tool, one transformation, one system. Never dilute a post with multiple unrelated ideas.

### 2. Specific Numbers Stop the Scroll
Both creators use exact dollar amounts, not vague claims. "$50k/month agency" not "expensive agency." "$10m+ in 2026" not "a lot of money." "99.999% of people" not "most people." Specificity is credibility.

### 3. Every Line Must Earn Its Place
Greg writes one sentence per line with heavy white space. Elliot uses more structured formatting but still keeps each line scannable. The shared lesson: if a sentence doesn't add value, cut it. Mobile-first means every line is a decision point for the reader to keep scrolling or stop.

### 4. Bold Claims Build Followings
Greg softens with "probably" and "I think" — which paradoxically makes bold claims MORE believable. Elliot backs bold claims with specific tools and results. Use both: make the bold claim, soften it slightly, then prove it.

### 5. Emotional Closers Create Connection
Greg ends with "I'm rooting for you." and "what a time to be alive." Elliot ends with "Happy building" and impact statements. The lesson: never end a post on information alone. End on feeling. The last line is the one people remember.

### 6. Show the Opportunity, Then the Method
Greg paints the vision ("you probably can make $10m+"). Elliot shows the execution ("Here's the exact setup"). The best posts do BOTH — but lead with the opportunity to hook people, then deliver the method to keep them.

### 7. Anti-Gatekeeping Energy
Both creators share the same core belief: expensive services and gatekept knowledge are being democratized by AI. This underpins everything. The reader should always feel "I can do this too."

### 8. Honest Caveats Build Trust
Greg: "Hard to scale if you don't [have distribution]." Elliot: "This isn't a rigid workflow." Acknowledging limitations makes the rest of your claims more credible. One honest caveat per post is powerful.

## Voice Rules — Elliot Garreffa (Default)

### Tone
- Conversational, casual, direct
- Lowercase openings are common ("ok..." / "so...")
- Anti-gatekeeping: "you can do this too" energy
- Results-focused with specific numbers
- Educational over promotional
- Excited but grounded

### Signature Language
- "So... I now have a $X/month [service], directly in my Claude"
- "ok... you're drowning in [pain point]"
- "The craziest part?"
- "This changes everything."
- "Meanwhile, I [new better way]."
- "Happy building"

### Words to AVOID
- "I would like to share..." / "In this post..."
- "Leverage" / "utilize" / "facilitate"
- Any formal or corporate phrasing
- Engagement begging ("like if you agree")

---

## Post Structure (Target: 242 words, 20 lines)

```
[HOOK - 1-2 sentences that stop the scroll]

[CONTEXT - 2-3 sentences about the problem/situation]

[TRANSITION - "The craziest part?" / "Meanwhile..." / or just white space]

[MAIN CONTENT - 15-20 lines with arrows or emoji numbers or flowing prose]

[IMPACT STATEMENT - bold closing insight]

[EMOTIONAL CLOSER - optional: "Happy building" / aspirational line]

[CTA - Lead Magnets only: "Comment '[KEYWORD]'"]
```

### Formatting Toolkit

Use the right format for the content. Mix and match within a post.

**Arrows (->)** — For feature/capability lists (Elliot signature):
```
-> Extract contact data from Apollo and LinkedIn
-> Analyse customer reviews to find pain points
-> Score leads based on review sentiment
```

**Emoji Numbers** — For tutorial steps (Elliot signature):
```
1 Gather the data
2 Analyse everything
3 Build the report
```

**">" Quote Blocks** — For sequential predictions or cascading narratives (Greg technique):
```
> saas companies see BIG productivity gains from AI
> saas companies lay OFF 100,000+ workers
> laid off workers become founders out of necessity
> most struggle with distribution, not code
```

**Checkmarks** — For before/after comparisons (Elliot signature):
```
Most teams are still manually:
x Reviewing websites and taking notes
x Jumping between 5+ SEO tools

Meanwhile, with Claude + MCPs:
- One conversation handles everything
- Real data validates every decision
```

**One-sentence-per-line** — For philosophical or visionary sections (Greg technique):
```
This is the greatest time to build businesses in history.

The rules are loose. The map is unfinished. The upside is wide open.

Enjoy it.
```

Use arrows and emoji numbers for HOW-TO content. Use one-sentence-per-line and ">" blocks for VISIONARY content. Many posts benefit from mixing both.

## CTA Patterns

### Lead Magnet CTA (REQUIRED for Lead Magnet posts)
```
Want the complete [guide/setup/playbook]?

- Comment '[KEYWORD]'
- I'll send you access (connect so I can DM)

I'll DM you everything

Happy building
```

### Soft CTA (Non-lead-magnet posts)
```
Let me know what you think
```
or
```
More [ideas/resources] at [link]
```

### No CTA (Opinion, Predictions, Punchy Wisdom)
End with an impact statement or emotional closer instead. No engagement begging.

---

## Greg Isenberg Mode

When the user says "write this in Greg's style" or "Greg Isenberg style":

1. Read `references/greg-isenberg-style.md` for the complete voice guide
2. Shift to Greg's voice: lowercase, one-sentence-per-line, visionary not educational
3. Use Greg's post types: Opportunity Thesis, Future Prediction, Philosophical, Punchy Wisdom, Curated Analysis
4. Drop Elliot-specific formatting: no arrows, no emoji numbers, no checkmarks, no "The craziest part?"
5. Use ">" blocks for prediction chains, plain numbers for breakdowns
6. End with emotional closers: "I'm rooting for you." / "what a time to be alive"
7. Keep posts shorter (50-250 words)
8. Soft CTAs only, never "Comment 'X'"

---

## Output Format

For each request, deliver:

```
---
CONTENT ANALYSIS
Core topic: [one sentence]
Best post types: [2-3 types selected]
---

### POST TYPE: [Name] -- Hook Variation [1/2/3]

[Complete LinkedIn post, ready to copy-paste]

Word count: [X] | Lines: [X]
Post type: [Type] | Hook: [Variation name]
Visual suggestion: [What to pair with]
Expected engagement: [Range based on historical data]

---
[Repeat for each variation]
---

TOP PICK: [Which post + why]
```

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Summarizing instead of owning** -- Write as if YOU did/built/tested it
2. **Too few use cases** -- Lead Magnets need 15-25 across 3-5 categories
3. **Wrong hook for content** -- Match hook to post type
4. **No CTA on Lead Magnets** -- Always include "Comment '[KEYWORD]'"
5. **Corporate voice** -- If it sounds like a press release, rewrite it
6. **Missing specificity** -- Exact dollar amounts, time savings, tool names
7. **Wall of text** -- Use white space, formatting, let thoughts breathe
8. **Ending on information** -- End on emotion or impact, not facts
9. **Being too safe** -- Bold claims softened with "probably" are more believable than safe claims
10. **No honest caveats** -- One limitation per post builds trust

---

## Tips for Maximum Engagement

- **Video posts get 6x more engagement** for tutorials and demos
- **"So..." hook + dollar amounts** = highest performing combination
- **Ultra-short posts** (under 50 words) can massively outperform longer ones
- **Posts combining multiple types** outperform single-type posts
- **">" prediction chains** drive high comment engagement
- **Emotional closers** increase shares
- **Post Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10am or 12-1pm** for peak visibility
