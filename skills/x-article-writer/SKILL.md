# X Article Writer

Create compelling long-form X Articles that argue a position, teach a framework, or break down a system.

Read `viral-examples.md` for real articles demonstrating these principles before writing.

## The Writing Philosophy

These articles work because they treat the reader as intelligent. They don't hype. They don't beg for engagement. They make an argument with evidence and let the ideas do the work.

The voice is: builder sharing what they've learned. Analytical but accessible. Specific but not academic. Opinionated but earned through argument, not provocation.

## What Makes These Articles Work

After analyzing top-performing articles, these are the patterns that consistently drive engagement:

1. **Thesis-first hooks** — Open with what the article argues, not just personal credentials
2. **Concrete specifics** — Dollar amounts, percentages, latency numbers, real company names
3. **Named frameworks** — Categories and taxonomies readers can apply to their own situation
4. **Sections as self-contained arguments** — Each section has its own thesis, evidence, and conclusion
5. **Mixed sentence rhythm** — Short punchy lines AND flowing explanatory passages
6. **Failure modes included** — "How this goes wrong" or "But the boundary shifts" — nuance builds trust
7. **Actionable closes** — Checklists, timelines, or specific next steps

## The Article Formula

### Step 1: The Hook (First 5-10 Lines)

The hook establishes the thesis, not just personal credentials. There are several patterns that work:

**Pattern A — Historical/Intellectual Anchor:**
```
[Reference to established idea, research, or historical moment].

[Why that idea held for a long time].

[What's changing now — the thesis].
```

Example: "In 1937, Ronald Coase asked a question that won him a Nobel Prize: if markets are so efficient, why do firms exist at all? His answer was transaction costs. For almost a century, that held. AI agents are changing the math."

**Pattern B — Personal Experience as Evidence:**
```
[What you built or did recently — specific details].

[The unexpected consequence or insight].

[The bigger question this raises — the thesis].
```

Example: "I've been building my AI chief of staff over the past couple weeks. She has access to my calendar, email, our team's Notion workspace. And I've stopped opening half my tools. Not because they're bad. Because my agent replaced the need to."

**Pattern C — Contrarian Reframe:**
```
[What most people think about the topic].

[Your credentials or scale — specific numbers].

[Where the real insight actually lives].
```

Example: "most people think an ai skill is a well-written instruction file. a really good SKILL.md with examples, scoring criteria, maybe a decision tree. that's the baseline. we built 11 marketing skills. 32,000 lines. the skills themselves were the easy part. the architecture around them is where the real gains came from."

**Pattern D — Diagnosis → Prescription:**
```
[The diagnosis everyone already agrees on, with quotes/citations].

[What's missing from the conversation].

[What this article provides].
```

Example: "You've heard the diagnosis. Satya Nadella said SaaS is dead. 80% of apps will become APIs or disappear. What's missing is the prescription: if apps are dying, what do you build instead?"

The hook does two things:
1. Establishes what the article argues (the thesis)
2. Signals that the reader will get something they can use

### Step 2: The Thesis Statement

After the hook, make the argument explicit. One to three sentences that tell the reader exactly what position this article takes.

**Pattern:**
```
[The core claim in one sentence].

[Why it matters / who it affects].

[What the article will cover].
```

Example: "When search costs collapse, the default shifts from 'build it in-house' to 'buy it on the open market.' And the buyers aren't humans. They're software with budgets."

The thesis should be quotable. If someone screenshots one sentence from your article, it should be this one.

### Step 3: Section Structure

Each section is a self-contained argument. Use clear headers — either formal or lowercase casual depending on the article's tone.

**Pattern A — Argument Sections:**
```
## [Section Title]

[Opening statement — the key claim in 1-2 sentences]

[Evidence — concrete numbers, examples, comparisons]

[Implications — what this means for the reader]

[One-liner payoff — the sentence that lands]
```

**Pattern B — Problem/Fix/Result:**
```
## [Component Name]

the problem: [what's broken, in one sentence]

the fix: [what you did about it, with specifics]

[Implementation details — file names, numbers, technical specifics]

the result: [what changed, measurably]
```

**Pattern C — Framework/Taxonomy:**
```
## [Framework Name]

[Category 1]: [definition]. [Example]. [Implication].

[Category 2]: [definition]. [Example]. [Implication].

[Category 3]: [definition]. [Example]. [Implication].
```

Example of named taxonomy: "Dead on arrival: CRUD tools, dashboards. Vulnerable but defensible: Workflow tools, CRMs. Trenchcoat companies: Multiple businesses in one. Last to fall: Creative tools, design surfaces."

### Step 4: Sentence Rhythm

This is NOT rigidly one-sentence-per-line. The rhythm should vary:

**Short lines for emphasis:**
```
The math is the decision.

You don't sell intelligence. Agents have plenty of that.
```

**Flowing passages for explanation:**
```
A specialized service with a curated catalog returns the same answer for $0.01-0.02 in under 200 milliseconds. Accuracy is higher because it's maintained data, not generated reasoning.
```

**Lists within prose (using natural language, not bullet points):**
```
Finding a specialist, evaluating their work, negotiating a price, enforcing the agreement. All of that takes time and money.
```

The principle: short sentences land key points. Longer sentences build the argument. Alternate between them. The contrast creates rhythm.

### Step 5: Concrete Specifics

Every claim needs specifics. This is non-negotiable.

**Bad:** "It's much faster and cheaper to use a specialized service."

**Good:** "That's 7-50x cheaper and 50-100x faster. The math is the decision."

**Bad:** "We built a lot of skills and learned a lot."

**Good:** "We built 11 marketing skills. 32,000 lines. The skills themselves were the easy part."

Specifics include: dollar amounts, percentages, time comparisons, file names, tool names, company names, API endpoints, token counts, latency measurements. If you can put a number on it, put a number on it.

### Step 6: Include Failure Modes

Strong articles don't just say "do this." They say "do this, and here's how it goes wrong."

**Pattern:**
```
[Recommendation or framework].

How this goes wrong: [specific failure mode]. [What happens when it fails]. [The nuance that separates success from failure].
```

Example: "How this goes wrong: You go headless but your API is poorly documented, rate-limited to uselessness, or missing critical endpoints. Agents route around you to a competitor who did it right. Headless only works if the API is genuinely great."

Including failure modes:
- Shows you've actually done the thing (not just theorized)
- Builds trust through nuance
- Gives the reader a more complete mental model
- Makes the article more useful than a simple "do X"

### Step 7: The Close

End with something the reader can act on. Three patterns:

**Pattern A — Actionable Timeline:**
```
This week: [immediate action].

This month: [medium-term action].

This quarter: [strategic action].

[One-liner that captures the stakes].
```

**Pattern B — Checklist with Reasoning:**
```
[Action 1]. [Why it matters in one sentence].

[Action 2]. [Why it matters].

[Action 3]. [Why it matters].

[Closing line that reframes the entire article].
```

**Pattern C — Progressive Payoff:**
```
Day 1: [what happens immediately].
Day 7: [what improves].
Day 14: [what transforms].

[One sentence capturing what all of this adds up to].
```

**Then add a CTA tied to the article's topic:**
```
If you're [specific audience doing specific thing], [what you offer].

[Newsletter/resource link — specific, not generic].
```

## Article Types

### Type 1: Thesis-Driven Explainer

The article argues a position about how the world is changing.

**Structure:**
- Historical anchor or intellectual framing → thesis
- 3-5 sections, each a self-contained argument with evidence
- Concrete specifics: dollar amounts, percentages, time comparisons
- Failure modes or nuances for each claim
- Actionable checklist or timeline close

**Best for:** Industry shifts, emerging trends, strategic analysis, "here's what X means for your business"

**Tone:** Analytical, authoritative, specific. Write like an essayist, not a marketer.

### Type 2: Builder's Breakdown

The article shows how you built something, with real implementation details.

**Structure:**
- Contrarian reframe + scale numbers (how many, how big)
- Numbered components using problem/fix/result structure
- Technical specifics: file names, architecture decisions, numbers
- Progressive payoff showing compounding value
- CTA tied to the system you built

**Best for:** Technical tutorials, system design, workflow breakdowns, "here's what we actually built"

**Tone:** Lowercase casual. Builder sharing notes. Heavy on specifics, light on hype.

### Type 3: Industry Analysis

The article diagnoses what's happening in an industry and prescribes what to do about it.

**Structure:**
- Personal experience as evidence → industry diagnosis with cited sources
- Named taxonomy or framework (3-4 categories with memorable labels)
- Each category with definition, examples, and implications
- "How this goes wrong" for each recommendation
- Timeline close: this week / this month / this quarter

**Best for:** Market shifts, strategic decisions, "if X is dying, what do you build instead?"

**Tone:** Mix of personal experience and analytical distance. Name real companies and people.

### Type 4: Complete Tutorial

The article teaches how to do something specific, step by step.

**Structure:**
- Credentials or transformation hook → "here's everything you need"
- Numbered sections, each teaching one concept
- Code examples, file structures, or screenshots where relevant
- Blockquote key principles using ">"
- TLDR summary + specific CTA

**Best for:** Technical how-tos, framework guides, tool tutorials

**Tone:** Conversational but authoritative. "Here's how this actually works."

## Formatting Rules

### Headers

Use clear section headers. Match the article's tone:

**Analytical:** `## The buy vs. build calculation`

**Builder casual:** `## 1. persistent memory`

**Framework:** `## Three Futures for SaaS`

**Provocative:** `## Apps are dead. Now what?`

### Blockquotes

Use ">" sparingly for:
- Key principles that deserve emphasis
- Rules or frameworks within a section
- Quotable one-liners

```
> You don't sell intelligence. Agents have plenty of that. You sell access to things they literally cannot compute on their own.
```

Don't overuse blockquotes. If everything is emphasized, nothing is.

### Code Blocks and Technical Details

Include when relevant:
- File structures and architecture
- Specific configurations
- API examples
- Implementation details

Technical specificity builds trust. "voice-profile.md ← /brand-voice owns" is more credible than "we created files for each skill."

### Sentence Length

Mix deliberately:
- **Short (< 10 words):** For key claims and payoffs. "The math is the decision."
- **Medium (10-25 words):** For most explanatory content.
- **Long (25+ words):** For complex arguments that need setup. Use sparingly.

The short sentences only land because the longer ones set them up. You need both.

## Title Formulas

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| [Provocative claim]. Now what? | "Apps are dead. Now what?" |
| How to [verb] to [audience] | "How to Sell to Agents" |
| i stopped [common approach] and started [better approach] | "i stopped writing better skills and started building skill architecture" |
| [topic] for [audience]: the only guide you need | "agent commerce for SaaS founders: the only guide you need" |
| everything I've learned about [topic] | "everything I've learned about selling to machines" |
| the [adjective] guide to [topic] | "the complete guide to agent-native services" |
| why [common belief] is wrong | "why your API strategy is backwards" |
| [number] things that [outcome] | "5 things we added and why each one moved the needle" |

Lowercase titles feel like a builder sharing notes. Capitalized titles feel like published essays. Match the article's tone.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Generic transformation hooks** — Don't default to "X months ago I was nobody, now I'm successful." Open with a thesis, not a humble brag. Authority comes from the quality of the argument.

2. **Vague claims without specifics** — "It's much better" means nothing. "7-50x cheaper and 50-100x faster" means everything. If you can't put a number on it, find an example.

3. **Forced "spicy takes"** — Strong opinions should be earned through argument, not dropped for shock value. "You don't sell intelligence" works because the preceding section proved it.

4. **Rigidly one-sentence-per-line** — Use short lines for emphasis, flowing passages for explanation. Varying the rhythm is what makes both effective.

5. **Sections without self-contained arguments** — Each section should have its own thesis, evidence, and conclusion. A reader should be able to screenshot any section and get value from it alone.

6. **Missing failure modes** — If you only say "do this," the reader doesn't trust that you've actually done it. Include "how this goes wrong" to show nuance.

7. **Generic CTAs** — "Subscribe to my newsletter" is weak. "If you're building agent-native services, here's where I break down the economics weekly" is specific.

8. **No framework or taxonomy** — Give readers mental models they can apply. Named categories ("Dead on arrival", "Trenchcoat companies") are memorable and shareable.
