# X to LinkedIn Converter v3.0

## Purpose
Transform X (Twitter) posts into LinkedIn posts with **automatic post type detection** and **multiple hook variations**, using a unified writing engine built from analysis of 200+ posts across top creators.

The default voice is **Elliot Garreffa** — but the writing engine is informed by proven patterns from **Greg Isenberg** and other top performers. Greg's best techniques (emotional closers, one-sentence-per-line breathing room, bold claims softened with "probably", the ">" chain format for predictions, ultra-short micro-posts) are available as tools in every conversion, not locked behind a style switch.

**Default mode**: Elliot's voice + the best structural and emotional techniques from Greg, blended naturally.

**Greg Isenberg mode**: When the user says "convert in Greg's style" or "Greg Isenberg style", shift to predominantly Greg's voice — lowercase, one-sentence-per-line, visionary not educational, no arrows or emoji numbers.

## How This Works

When you paste an X post, this skill will:

1. **Analyze the content** to determine which LinkedIn post types it fits
2. **Select the top 2-3 most relevant types**
3. **For each type, generate a full LinkedIn post (target: 242 words, 20 lines)**
4. **Create 3 hook variations** for each post type
5. **Result**: 6-9 complete LinkedIn posts to choose from

## Core Writing Principles (Apply to EVERY Conversion)

These principles apply to EVERY post regardless of type, voice, or source content. They are the foundation of the writing engine.

### 1. One Big Idea Per Post
Greg's highest-performing post was two sentences (1,287 engagement). Elliot's best posts focus on one tool, one transformation, one system. When converting an X thread, distill to ONE core idea — don't try to preserve every point.

### 2. Specific Numbers Stop the Scroll
Both creators use exact dollar amounts, not vague claims. "$50k/month agency" not "expensive agency." "$10m+ in 2026" not "a lot of money." "99.999% of people" not "most people." When converting, ALWAYS preserve or add specific numbers. Specificity is credibility.

### 3. Every Line Must Earn Its Place
Greg writes one sentence per line with heavy white space. Elliot uses more structured formatting but still keeps each line scannable. If a sentence doesn't add value, cut it. Mobile-first means every line is a decision point for the reader to keep scrolling or stop.

### 4. Bold Claims Build Followings
Greg softens with "probably" and "I think" — which paradoxically makes bold claims MORE believable. Elliot backs bold claims with specific tools and results. Use both: make the bold claim, soften it slightly, then prove it.

### 5. Emotional Closers Create Connection
Greg ends with "I'm rooting for you." and "what a time to be alive." Elliot ends with "Happy building" and impact statements. Never end a post on information alone. End on feeling. The last line is the one people remember.

### 6. Show the Opportunity, Then the Method
Greg paints the vision ("you probably can make $10m+"). Elliot shows the execution ("Here's the exact setup"). The best posts do BOTH — lead with the opportunity to hook people, then deliver the method to keep them.

### 7. Anti-Gatekeeping Energy
Both creators share the same core belief: expensive services and gatekept knowledge are being democratized by AI. This underpins everything. The reader should always feel "I can do this too."

### 8. Honest Caveats Build Trust
Greg: "Hard to scale if you don't [have distribution]." Elliot: "This isn't a rigid workflow." Acknowledging limitations makes the rest of your claims more credible. One honest caveat per post is powerful.

## Voice Rules — Elliot Garreffa (Default)

### Tone
- Conversational, casual, direct
- Lowercase openings are common ("ok..." / "so...")
- Anti-gatekeeping: "you can do this too" energy
- Results-focused with specific numbers
- Educational over promotional
- Excited but grounded

### Signature Language
- "So... I now have a $X/month [service], directly in my Claude"
- "ok... you're drowning in [pain point]"
- "The craziest part?"
- "This changes everything."
- "Meanwhile, I [new better way]."
- "Happy building"

### Words to AVOID
- "I would like to share..." / "In this post..."
- "Leverage" / "utilize" / "facilitate"
- Any formal or corporate phrasing
- Engagement begging ("like if you agree")

## Post Structure (Target: 242 words, 20 lines)

```
[HOOK - 1-2 sentences that stop the scroll]

[CONTEXT - 2-3 sentences about the problem/situation]

[TRANSITION - "The craziest part?" / "Meanwhile..." / or just white space]

[MAIN CONTENT - 15-20 lines with arrows or emoji numbers or flowing prose]

[IMPACT STATEMENT - bold closing insight]

[EMOTIONAL CLOSER - optional: "Happy building" / aspirational line]

[CTA - Lead Magnets only: "Comment '[KEYWORD]'"]
```

### Formatting Toolkit

Use the right format for the content. Mix and match within a post.

**Arrows (→)** — For feature/capability lists (Elliot signature):
```
→ Extract contact data from Apollo and LinkedIn
→ Analyse customer reviews to find pain points
→ Score leads based on review sentiment
```

**Emoji Numbers** — For tutorial steps (Elliot signature):
```
1️⃣ Gather the data
2️⃣ Analyse everything
3️⃣ Build the report
```

**">" Quote Blocks** — For sequential predictions or cascading narratives (Greg technique):
```
> saas companies see BIG productivity gains from AI
> saas companies lay OFF 100,000+ workers
> laid off workers become founders out of necessity
> most struggle with distribution, not code
```

**Checkmarks** — For before/after comparisons (Elliot signature):
```
Most teams are still manually:
❌ Reviewing websites and taking notes
❌ Jumping between 5+ SEO tools

Meanwhile, with Claude + MCPs:
✅ One conversation handles everything
✅ Real data validates every decision
```

**One-sentence-per-line** — For philosophical or visionary sections (Greg technique):
```
This is the greatest time to build businesses in history.

The rules are loose. The map is unfinished. The upside is wide open.

Enjoy it.
```

Use arrows and emoji numbers for HOW-TO content. Use one-sentence-per-line and ">" blocks for VISIONARY content. Many posts benefit from mixing both.

## Conversion Process

### Step 1: Detect Post Types

Analyze the X post to identify which LinkedIn types it matches:

| X Content | LinkedIn Type |
|-----------|---------------|
| Big result with dollar amount | Lead Magnet, Cost Transformation |
| New tool/feature announcement | Tool Announcement, Tutorial |
| Cost savings claim | Cost Transformation, Lead Magnet |
| Step-by-step or method | Tutorial, Lead Magnet |
| Contrarian take or trend | Opinion/Hot Take, Future Prediction |
| Company/team update | Behind the Scenes |
| Test results or build | Results/Case Study, Tutorial |
| Question or insight | Thought Leadership |
| Business opportunity or idea | Opportunity Thesis, Punchy Wisdom |
| Macro trend / industry shift | Future Prediction, Opinion/Hot Take |
| Single bold insight or one-liner | Punchy Wisdom, Opinion/Hot Take |

### Step 2: Select Top 2-3 Types

Use this priority matrix:

| X Content About | Primary | Secondary | Tertiary |
|-----------------|---------|-----------|----------|
| Agency-level AI service | Lead Magnet | Cost Transformation | Tutorial |
| New tool release | Tool Announcement | Tutorial | Lead Magnet |
| Cost savings | Cost Transformation | Lead Magnet | Tutorial |
| Step-by-step guide | Tutorial | Lead Magnet | Results |
| Contrarian take | Opinion/Hot Take | Future Prediction | -- |
| Company update | Behind the Scenes | Lead Magnet | Results |
| Test results | Results/Case Study | Tutorial | Lead Magnet |
| Business opportunity or idea | Opportunity Thesis | Punchy Wisdom | Opinion |
| Macro trend / industry shift | Future Prediction | Opinion/Hot Take | -- |
| Single bold insight | Punchy Wisdom | Opinion/Hot Take | -- |

### Step 3: Generate Full LinkedIn Posts

For each selected post type, create a complete LinkedIn post with:
- Appropriate hook for that type
- Full context and explanation
- 15-25 use cases (if applicable)
- Step-by-step tutorial (if applicable)
- Impact statement
- **Emotional closer** (e.g. "Happy building", aspirational line)
- CTA (if Lead Magnet type)
- **One honest caveat** somewhere in the post (builds trust)
- **Specific numbers** — preserve ALL numbers from the X post, add more where possible

### Step 4: Create 3 Hook Variations

For each post type, create 3 different hooks using that type's hook patterns.

## Expansion Strategies

### From X Micro (50-100 chars) → LinkedIn (242 words)

**X**: "I built a $50k/month research agency in claude"

**LinkedIn Expansion**:
1. **Hook**: Expand to full "So..." statement with specifics
2. **Add context**: What problem this solves, what people are doing wrong (2-3 sentences)
3. **Add "How is this possible?"**: Explain the tech/tools (2-3 sentences)
4. **Add use cases**: 15-25 specific examples across 3-4 categories with arrows →
5. **Add tutorial**: 1️⃣2️⃣3️⃣ steps showing how it works
6. **Add impact**: "The craziest part?" statement (2-3 sentences)
7. **Add emotional closer**: "Happy building" / aspirational line
8. **Add CTA**: "Comment '[KEYWORD]'" for guide (if Lead Magnet)

**Result**: ~250 words, 20 lines

---

### From X Complete (240-280 chars) → LinkedIn (242 words)

**LinkedIn Expansion**:
1. **Expand hook**: Add more emotion and specifics
2. **Add context paragraph**: 3-4 sentences on what people are doing wrong
3. **Add "How is this possible?"**: Explain the release/tech
4. **Expand 3 bullets into 15-25**: Each category gets 4-6 sub-examples
5. **Add step-by-step**: 1️⃣2️⃣3️⃣ how to use it
6. **Add specific example**: "I tested this on..."
7. **Add impact**: "The craziest part?" paragraph
8. **Add honest caveat**: One limitation that builds trust
9. **Add emotional closer**: End on feeling, not information
10. **Add CTA**: Full guide offer (if Lead Magnet)

**Result**: ~250 words, 20 lines

---

### From X Thread (4-6 tweets) → LinkedIn (242 words)

**LinkedIn Expansion**:
1. **Use Tweet 1 as hook**: Keep the punch
2. **Distill to ONE big idea**: Don't try to preserve every tweet
3. **Add context**: Between hook and main content
4. **Expand key points**: Turn each into a section with sub-examples
5. **Add honest caveat**: One limitation builds trust
6. **Add emotional closer**: End on feeling
7. **Use CTA from thread**: Expand to LinkedIn format

**Result**: ~250 words, 20 lines

---

### From X One-Liner → LinkedIn Punchy Wisdom or Opportunity Thesis

Some X posts are pure signal — a bold insight in one line. These can convert into:

**Punchy Wisdom** (ultra-short, under 50 words):
- Keep the energy of the original
- Add 1-2 lines of expansion maximum
- End with an emotional closer
- NO CTA, NO formatting. Just raw signal.

**Opportunity Thesis** (expand the insight into a business idea):
- Use the X insight as the hook
- Walk through the business model in casual prose
- End with "I'm rooting for you." or similar
- Use ">" blocks if chaining predictions

---

## CTA Patterns

### Lead Magnet CTA (REQUIRED for Lead Magnet posts)
```
Want the complete [guide/setup/playbook]?

- Comment '[KEYWORD]'
- I'll send you access (connect so I can DM)

I'll DM you everything

Happy building
```

### Soft CTA (Non-lead-magnet posts)
```
Let me know what you think
```
or
```
More [ideas/resources] at [link]
```

### No CTA (Opinion, Predictions, Punchy Wisdom)
End with an impact statement or emotional closer instead. No engagement begging.

---

## Greg Isenberg Mode

When the user says "convert in Greg's style" or "Greg Isenberg style":

1. Shift to Greg's voice: lowercase, one-sentence-per-line, visionary not educational
2. Use Greg's post types: Opportunity Thesis, Future Prediction, Philosophical, Punchy Wisdom
3. Drop Elliot-specific formatting: no arrows, no emoji numbers, no checkmarks, no "The craziest part?"
4. Use ">" blocks for prediction chains, plain numbers for breakdowns
5. End with emotional closers: "I'm rooting for you." / "what a time to be alive"
6. Keep posts shorter (50-250 words)
7. Soft CTAs only, never "Comment 'X'"
8. Soften bold claims with "probably" and "I think"

---

## Output Format

When converting an X post, provide:

```markdown
---
CONTENT ANALYSIS
Core topic: [one sentence]
X Format: [Micro/Compact/Complete/Thread]
Best post types: [2-3 types selected]
Key metrics to preserve: [dollar amounts, time savings, etc.]
Tools mentioned: [list]
---

### POST TYPE: [Name] (Avg Engagement: X) — Hook Variation [1/2/3]

[Complete LinkedIn post, ready to copy-paste]

Word count: [X] | Lines: [X]
Post type: [Type] | Hook: [Variation name]
Visual suggestion: [What to pair with]
Expected engagement: [Range based on historical data]

---
[Repeat for each variation and type]
---

TOP PICK: [Which post + why]
```

---

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing, verify each LinkedIn post has:

- [ ] 200-300 words (target: 242)
- [ ] 15-25 lines (target: 20)
- [ ] Hook matches post type
- [ ] Context paragraph (what people are doing wrong)
- [ ] Transition ("The craziest part?" / "Meanwhile..." / white space)
- [ ] Main content uses appropriate formatting (arrows, emoji numbers, ">" blocks, one-sentence-per-line)
- [ ] 15-25 use cases if tool/service announcement
- [ ] Step-by-step if tutorial
- [ ] Impact statement
- [ ] **Emotional closer** (end on feeling, not information)
- [ ] **One honest caveat** (builds trust)
- [ ] CTA with "Comment '[KEYWORD]'" if Lead Magnet
- [ ] Maintains voice (Elliot default or Greg if requested)
- [ ] Includes **specific numbers/metrics** (preserved from X post + added)
- [ ] More educational than X version
- [ ] Visual suggestion provided
- [ ] **Bold claims softened with "probably" or backed with proof**
- [ ] **Anti-gatekeeping energy** ("you can do this too")
- [ ] **No corporate phrasing** (no "leverage", "utilize", "facilitate")

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Summarizing instead of owning** — Write as if YOU did/built/tested it
2. **Too few use cases** — Lead Magnets need 15-25 across 3-5 categories
3. **Wrong hook for content** — Match hook to post type
4. **No CTA on Lead Magnets** — Always include "Comment '[KEYWORD]'"
5. **Corporate voice** — If it sounds like a press release, rewrite it
6. **Missing specificity** — Exact dollar amounts, time savings, tool names
7. **Wall of text** — Use white space, formatting, let thoughts breathe
8. **Ending on information** — End on emotion or impact, not facts
9. **Being too safe** — Bold claims softened with "probably" are more believable than safe claims
10. **No honest caveats** — One limitation per post builds trust
11. **Not expanding enough** — X is 280 chars, LinkedIn is 242 words. 10-15x expansion required.
12. **Losing the X post's energy** — Preserve the punch while expanding
13. **Trying to keep everything from a thread** — Distill to ONE big idea

---

## Tips for Maximum Engagement

- **Video posts get 6x more engagement** for tutorials and demos — always suggest video
- **"So..." hook + dollar amounts** = highest performing combination
- **Ultra-short posts** (under 50 words) can massively outperform longer ones — consider Punchy Wisdom
- **Posts combining multiple types** outperform single-type posts
- **">" prediction chains** drive high comment engagement
- **Emotional closers** increase shares
- **Post Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10am or 12-1pm** for peak visibility
- **One honest caveat per post** makes everything else more believable
